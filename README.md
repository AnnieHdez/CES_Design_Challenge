# CES_Design_Challenge

Generic and adaptable table that can load data in JSON format from different sources and display them correctly. It can render tables with different types of data and numbers of columns. The type of each column is taken into consideration to display its data appropriately. The width of each column can be defined by the user. This table has pagination and allows us to define the number of records to show per page. It receives the names of the tables to show and the amounts of the records per page. This project was implemented using Angular 10, with TypeScript 4 and Bootstrap 4.
