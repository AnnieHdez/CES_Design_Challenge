# CesDesingChallenge
Generic and adaptable table that can load data in JSON format from different sources and display them correctly. It can render tables with different types of data and numbers of columns. The type of each column is taken into consideration to display its data appropriately. The width of each column can be defined by the user. This table has pagination and allows us to define the number of records to show per page. It receives the names of the tables to show and the amounts of the records per page. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.2, using Angular 10, with TypeScript 4 and Bootstrap 4.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
